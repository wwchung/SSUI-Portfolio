          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>WarSound is a cost-effective military training solution that simulates a realistic combat experience through audio. It is an Android application that the user can mix and match multiple sounds from a battlefield and generate multiple combat scenarios.</p>

          <h1>Problem</h1>
          <p>During my military service in Korea, I was assisting my commander conduct a military exercise. A battlefield sound was playing in the background, but my commander wanted a more realistic sound and asked me to find a better one. While looking for a better battlefield sound, I also wanted to improve on the controls that was being used at the training field. It was an old cassette-style audio system that had some inconvenient controls. Thus, I decided to implement my own control system through a mobile application.</p>

      <div class="row" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="250" data-aos-once="true" data-aos-anchor="#trigger">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h1>Process</h1>
          <p>The first iteration was an app with a simple button to play and pause the battlefield sound. The color of the button changed to indicate the status of the sound: playing or paused. After a field test, I realized the possibility of this app and decided to incorporate more sounds to allow the user to generate multiple combat scenarios depending on the combination of sounds the user turned on. The second iteration had multiple sounds displayed as a list. The user could scroll up and down the list to turn on or off the sound the user wanted. During the field test, I also noticed that this list layout was inconvenient since the user had to scroll up and down to turn the sounds on and off. The third iteration improved on this layout and had the sounds displayed as a grid. With more sounds that were able to fill up the screen, the user needed to scroll less and easily turn the sounds on and off. I also incorporated a feature to loop the sound by long-pressing the button.</p>

          <h1>Solution</h1>
          <p>WarSound is a cost-effective solution to simulating multiple combat scenarios based on the combination of sounds that can be mixed and matched on the app. It is a simple mobile application, but it is well-appreciated by other military commanders in the army. The app currently has more than 4,700 downloads and a 4.9/5.0 rating on Google Play.</p>
