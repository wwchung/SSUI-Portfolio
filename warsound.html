          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>WarSound is a cost-effective military training solution that simulates realistic combat experience using audio. It is an Android application that allows the user to mix and match multiple sounds from a battlefield to simulate different combat situations on a battlefield.</p>

          <h1>Problem</h1>
          <p>During my military service in South Korea, I was assisting my commander conduct military exercises for his unit. To make the military exercise more realistic, background music simulating a battlefield was played through the audio system. However, the commander did not find the music realistic enough and asked me to find a better music. While looking for a better background music, I found the controls on the audio system to be not flexible enough. Even the simple play and pause button was not responsive enough. This is why I decided to develop a mobile app to make better control.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h1>Process</h1>
          <p>The first iteration of the app was a simple button that played and paused the background music with a simple color change to indicate the music was playing or paused. Seeing bigger possibility in the app, I realized that not only one sound can be played or paused but multiple sounds as well. The second iteration of the app then included a list of different weapon sounds that the user can mix and play with multiple sounds. While using the app during the military training, I found that the list view was not convenient to switch between different sounds. The third iteration improved on the list view design to include a grid view design. It also allowed the user to loop the sound by long-pressing the button.</p>

          <h1>Solution</h1>
          <p>The app was effective in allowing the user to simulate different scenarios that can occur on an actual battlefield. The app was a cost-effective solution to the military audio equipment that requires more effort to implemented. The solution was simple yet extremely effective. Currently, the app was downloaded more than 4,700 times with a Google Play rating of 4.9/5.0.</p>
